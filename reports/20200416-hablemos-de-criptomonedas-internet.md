## Overview

This webinar was organized and co-hosted with [Ibero University](https://www.iberopuebla.mx/) through their innovation hub [IDIT](https://www.iberopuebla.mx/site-idit/index.php/home). The university is keen to share knowledge about crypto and blockchain
to their student community and have previously partnered with ETH to offer a workshop on Solidity. I had previous contact with the director and we set up to co-organize a webinar on a more broad level so as to have as many students from all majors.
The webinar had 34 registrations with a turnaround of 22 attendees. It stretched up to 2 hours and we had 18 attendees throughout the talk. This was an entry level talk about cryptocurrencies, what is fiat money, what is a cryptocurrency, we reviewed the path of transactions from sent to received,
and the protocols that rule the newtwork: we reviewed Bitcoin PoW and illustrated some issues that arise from PoW only. From this point on, we reviewed Decred, going from sent to reveived, while
explaning the hybryd protocol and how it sustantially improves security. We then proceed to explain the off-chain governance and a brief but to-the-point explanation of the DAO. The duration was 80 min and we proceed to Q&A, where questions around the DAO were abundant.

## Goals

- For attendees to understand that protocols govern the blockchain and they must perform due dilligence on these while reviewing a cryptocurrency.
- To showcase Decred's strenghts in contrast with other protocol's weak points.
- To have a precedent within a university community and with their staff.

## Learnings and Outcomes

- Must record these events, a computer science teacher emailed me asking for the recording to show to his students and I sadly had none.
- We are still a bit unsure about email collection (latam team) because of privacy. I was offered the data base from the registration but given the lack of newsletter "in spanish" or specific use for it (we rely on SM followers and Telegram users in our channel), we passed out.
- The hub was very pleased with the webinar, we showcased Decred at a good depht but kept things at neutral too, so we got an open invitation to do a second in-person event, around August (if pandemic measures allow it) or later.
The idea is yet to be defined, but probably a workshop or hackathon. Since there is a constant influx of people on universities, we want to keep this collaborations as extended as possible, so as to create a vested community (with good awareness of DCR) and not just a once-shown audience.
- On a heatmap, this type of event falls a bit cold when it comes to creating new stakeholders, it's better catalogued as stage one on the journey (or funnel) of becoming a stakeholder.
- This event was low-cost and considering this to be a stage 1 event, we'll be doing as many as our current and future networks allow.
