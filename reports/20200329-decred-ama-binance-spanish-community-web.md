## Overall Experience

This AMA was held with the Binance en Español community in Telegram which has +8000 members, so needless to say it reached a very big audience. The format was divided into three segments:

1. The moderator asked five questions to the Decred team about the reason to implement a hybrid protocol, the DCR comic proposal currently on Politeia, lightning network, how Deced is unique compared to other cc and the state of things and futute plans for the project in Latin America.

2. The moderator shared a form where the participants had 2 min to submit what they liked the most about Decred. 4 participants were rewarded for the most creative answers. We obtained the form and the the thing that people liked the most was around Solo Staking and Voting Service Provider, for the latter we lack understanding if they wish to be one or are interested in joining one.

3. The moderator opened the forum and participants shared their questions for a 2 min period. 73 participants submitted a total of 155 questions. Most questions where open-ended and opinion seeking, mainly about the advantages of DCR against other cc, PoW-PoS protocol, and governance but there was a good amount of specific questions i.e. coin supply, staking, mining, VSP, treasury, trading positions, block rewards, initiatives to drive adoption, time stamping, network attacks, among others, and a handful of questions included some form of reference to SM "I saw xxx mentioned on a tweet/ in the first part of your YT video you explain..." in their formulation.

After the AMA was finished, there was an open conversation period where the community shared their perspectives on Decred. There was a decent acknowledgement of Decred's presence in Latin America and some inquire about future events in the region

## Learnings and Outcomes

- We obtained some form of validation about the efforts made in Latin America to build a presence and an audience are on a good track.

- We have a good amount of open-answers to the question "What do you like about Decred the most?"

- We gathered and documented a good amount of questions that can signal us where our prospect users are lacking information or a deeper understanding of Decred.

- We broke the record for the longest AMA held to this date by the Binance in Español community (~2.5 hrs)
