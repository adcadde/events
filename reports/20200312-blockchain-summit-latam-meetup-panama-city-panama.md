## Overall Experience

Blockchain Summit Latam has its roots in Chile and it's a well-positioned event for the divulgation, promotion and showcase of cryptocurrency and blockchain projects working in the Latam region. This event compends a series of keynotes from companies, cryptocurrency projects, non-profit organizations, educators and well-known speakers from the ecosystem.

Due to COVID-19 contingency plans, this year's 4th edition - to be held in Panama City - was cancelled. This event has been rescheduled and will take place on October 15-16, 2020. Decred is a silver sponsor and @elian has a keynote on the event.

The cancellation of this event occurred 24 hours before the event, therefore some speakers were already in the area. The event staff took the opportunity and hosted a small meetup where presenters got the chance to network and to know about the projects from close up.

The attendees of this flash meetup were representatives from OTC Desks, exchanges (Huobi, OKCoin and Binance), blockchain solutions (Signatura, Symbiont, Stamping, AVA Labs, Creatiblock), fiat on-ramps (Cryptobuyer, Localbitcoins), cryptocurrency projects (NEM, Kleros) and non-profits (LACC Chain, Talentland), fintech startups and service providers (Republic, Legal Paradox) coming from Venezuela, Uruguay, Spain, Honduras, Argentina, Peru, Colombia and Mexico.

## Outcomes and Learnings

- We secured the keynote slot and the status as a silver sponsor on the now rescheduled event.

- We got a small 3 min interview with Tech con Catalina. Details of this PR material are still unknown as this might be used as promotional material for the event once the new date is near.

- We talked with David Gan, director of global partnerships in Huobi about staking services. We further shared with his team all documentation with regards to staking and VSP. 

- We talked with Ezio Rojas from Cointelegraph and agreed on an interview about Decred which produced an article [now published](https://es.cointelegraph.com/news/decred-how-does-your-development-continue-during-the-bear-market) ("Decred: How does your development continue during the bear market?").

- Many attendees - newcomers and big names alike - were building up prospects to offer white-labelling solutions. The state of things in Latam is one where competition is being deployed, companies and startups are trying to build up their business and their reputation, it is still very early and this disorienting to discern competent brands from the ones in dire straits. This also shows us that Blockchain Summit Latam attracts many with business in mind, so it's a good event to get to know and catch up with the spirit of things in Latam.
